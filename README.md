# Mixed-Messages
A little application for the daily shot of philosophy. 
Focus is not on design but on training javascript skills.

## Project description (Codecademy)

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## My goal

My goal was to setup an application that randomly combines different parts of sentences to create a pseudophilosophical expression.
